When granting an Amazon EC2 instance access to an 
S3 bucket, you typically use an IAM role and associate
that role with the EC2 instance. The IAM role should 
have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket.
Below is an example of an S3 bucket policy that grants 
read access to objects for an IAM role associated with an 
EC2 instance:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}

Make sure to attach this policy to your S3 bucket.
Additionally, you need to ensure that the IAM role 
associated with your EC2 instance has the appropriate
permissions. You can attach this policy directly to 
the IAM role or use IAM policies to grant the necessary
permissions.

Here's an example IAM policy that you can attach to 
the IAM role associated with your EC2 instance:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
