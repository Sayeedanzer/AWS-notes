CRR   ( Cross region replication ) 
-----------------------------------------
Lets say, we have two buckets ( 1st bucket in mumbai
			   2nd  bucket in sydney )

We we upload the object in mumbai, 
 the object should also be available in sydney ).

As we are replicating an object in another region, 
it is called cross region replication.

vice-versa will not happen.
If we delete object in mumbai, it will not be deleted in sydney.
If we edit object in mumbai, it will not de edited in sydney.

Lets  create  bucket
bucket name -  mumbai-sfsdfgds
Region - mumbai
Next ----> Next ---> uncheck block all public access
Next ---> create bucket.


Lets create 2nd bucket in sydney
Lets  create  bucket
bucket name -  sydney-fhgfhfd
Region - sydney
Next ----> Next ---> uncheck block all public access
Next ---> create bucket.


Enable cross region replication in mumbai bucket
--------------------------------------------------


Select mumbai bucket --> Management ---> 
Replication Rules--> Create Replication Rule ---> 
Enable Bucket versioning ---> Replication Rule Name -  CRR1

Destination bucket --> Sydney bucket  --> Enable versioning --->  ---> IAM Role --> 

( TO establish connection between two regions, we need role )

IAM Role - Create new role 
Save.



Now, lets upload object in mumbai  bucket, it will be replicated in sydney bucket!!!!

++++++++++++++++++++++++


Transfer Accelaration  ( Have a look at ppt )
-------------------------
When we enable transfer accelaration, data will be transferred to edge location and then  from edge location data will be transferred to bucket.
( Look at the image )

Select mumbai bucket --->Properties ---> Transfer accelaration --->Edit ---> Enabled --- Save Changes.

How can we check the speed?
---------------------------------------
Properties -------> Transfer accelaration --> Learn More

 Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration Speed Comparison tool


---> want to compare your data transfer speed by region ( open in new tab )

we can compare
S3  direct upload speed
S3 acclerated transfer upload speed.
In this case, we cannot find much difference.
But in longer distances, we can find the difference.

Encryption
----------------
There are two types of encryption

1) AES - 256   ( Advanced ENcryption standard )  - Single encryption
2) AWS - KMS ( Key management service )  - Double encryption  ( More secured )

Select the required encryption.

Select the bucket -- Properties ---Default Encription -- Edit -- Enable

+++++++++++++++++++++++

Metadata and Tags
------------------------
Metadata -- To provide more information about the object in key-value pairs.
Keys are predefinied. eg: Content-type, Content-language  etc

tags -- To provide more information about the object in key-value pairs.
Keys and values we need to provide.


Select the object ---> Properties, we can see the metadata and tags.

++++++++++++++++

ACL and Bucket policy
------------------------
Select the bucket --> Permissions tab
ACL Edit -- Add grantee
Enter canonical ID   -- Save Changes


Note: ACL  we can apply  at bucket level and object level

Select the Object and provide the access by entering canonical ID 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Bucket policy, we can apply only to  bucket.

Select the bucket ---> Permission , We can see bucket policy.
Bucket Policy are written in JSON Code.

Bucket policy should be definied in JSON code.
Its the job of AWS administrator.

+++++++++++
Select any object ---> Permissions tab
Observe: We do not have bucket policy.
As bucket policy, we need to apply at  bucket level only.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::don't forget to change me/*"
        }
    ]
}

In this policy:

The "Effect" is "Allow", which means the specified action is allowed.
The "Principal" is "*", which means the policy applies to all users.
The "Action" is "s3:GetObject", which means permission is granted for the GetObject operation.
The "Resource" is "arn:aws:s3:::YourBucketName/*", which means the policy applies to all objects within the specified bucke

Life cycle management
-----------------------------
Lets create a new bucket


Select the bucket --> Management tab --> Create lifecycle  rule

Rule name - Myrule
This rule applies to all objects  -- I Acknowledge
Transit  current version of objects between storage classes

Standard 1A  -- 30 Days  
Add transition

One Zone-IA   -- 60 Days

Create Rule


From now,  any object uploaded in the bucket will follow the rule for transition.
