VPC ctnd....
Select  Mumbai region

Step 1: Create VPC   ( MyVPC )  - 10.0.0.0/16
Step 2: Create two subnets

subnet1 - 10.0.1.0/24 - WebSN
subnet2 - 10.0.2.0/24 - DbSN

Step 3: Enable public IP to subnet1

Step 4: Create Internet Gateway  attach to VPC  -- MyIGW
Step 5: Create Route table  --  InternetRT
Step 6: Attach Route table to subnet1
Step 7: Attach Route table to Internet Gateway
Now, subnet1 is public.

Review and launch --- Launch -- Download keypair --> ( webKP06.pem ) Launch-- View Instance

+++++++++++++++++++++


Lets Launch  Database Server in Private SUbnet.

Services ---Ec2 ---- Launch instance  -- Step3  Network : MyVPC
				          Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24

Name Tag: DbServer --  ---> Next  --  Security Group : DbSG06  , Description: DbSG06

Change Type   from SSH to MYSQL/Aurora

Type		Source		
MYSQL/Aurora	Custom		10.0.1.0/24

( MySQL Port is open to entire subnet )
Review and launch -- Launch --> Create new keypair --> (dbKP06.pem ) launch instances --- View instances

++++++++++++++++



Now, web server can pull data from database server.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++





DBA wants to create some files.  Wants to perform maintenance activity.
Can he connect?
As DB Server is not having  public IP and it is not having internect connectivity, DBA cannot connect.

For this, we need to create Bastion server/ Jump server  in public subnet
It is noting but normal EC2 Machine



Services -- EC2 -- Luanch -- Amazon Linux ---> select VPC , Select subnet

Name: BastionServer
Security Group: BastionSG06
Description: BastionSG06

(SSH  port  -- should be open to myself)
Type		Source
SSH		My IP

Review and launch -- launch -- Create new keypair  ---Bastion06.pem

View Instances

+++++++++++++++





Now, Only I can connect to Bastion server through SSH
From the Bastion server, I should able to jump into Dbserver.
That means, DbServer SSH port should be open to Bastion server.

Goto Dbserver security group  - DbSG06 ( new tab )
Select DbSG -- Inbound --Edit
Add Rule

Type		Source		
SSH		Custom		10.0.1.166/32  ( Private IP of bastion server)

Save.

Now, Lets test can we connect to DB server

In EC2 Dashboard --  select bastion server -- connect
copy user@public_ip

Open putty
Host Name - user@public_ip
Provide PPK  file -- Connect!
$  sudo su
# yum update  -y

From bastion-- we need to jump to dbserver

Now, to connect to DBserver, we need to enter the details to DBserver in Bastion server.

Select DbServer --- connect

Copy the entire ssh command.

As we are connecting from linux to linux  .pem file is enough.

Enter the ssh command in putty.
eg:
# ssh -i "DbKP7.pem" ec2-user@10.0.2.106

Note: To connect the .pem file need to be present in present working directory.

Now, we need to copy abc.pem file in bastion server.
It is there in our windows machine.

We use WINSCP to transfer the file from windows to linux

In google search for "WinSCP"
winscp.net  
download and run.

Open WINSCP
We will connet to bastion server using Winscp
host name:  user@ipaddress  
advanced ---Authentication --- private key file - select the ppk file -- open -- ok - login

Now, drag and drop the pem file  to bastion server.

In Putty
# ls   ( We should able to see the file )

Now connect to Dbserver by running the SSH command
# ssh -i "DbKP7.pem" ec2-user@10.0.2.106

You are now connected to DBserver!!!

--------------------------------------------


Now, In DB server, lets execute the following commands
$ sudo su
# 

Now I want to upgrade the latest version of MYSQL database

Command to upgrade MYSQL database
# yum install mysql -y

not successfull.
We cannot install, As we are not having internet connection to private subnet.

TO get internet connection, we create NAT server. ( Network Address Translator )

The purpose of NAT is to provide internet to private subnet.
We need to create NAT in public subnet.

In VPC Dashboard
NAT Gateways --> Create NAT Gateway  ( myNAT )
subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
Create new EIP ---> Create a NAT Gateway -- Close
NAT needs 2 min appox to get created.
Name it as NAT
++++++++++++++




What is Elastic IP  ?
It is similar to Static IP 
When we stop and start the EC2 Machines, public IP will change.

If you stop and start the machine, we you want the same public IP, then we create Elastic IP
Elastic IP is nothing but static public IP

Why do we need Elastic IP to NAT?
If incase NAT is down, entire private subnet will not get internet.
Then we restart the NAT again, then it acquire new public IP
When NAT acquire new public IP, there could be connection issue.
So we need Elastic IP to NAT

++++++++++++++++
NAT is a closed box. It does not have any ports concept.
So, No one can connect to NAT.

We cannot connect NAT to private Subnet.
So, we create RouteTable.
One end of RouteTable , I connect to NAT.
Another end of RouteTable, I Connect to private subnet.

Instead of creating new RouteTable, we can use default RouteTable which was created, when we created VPC

Lets change the name of default RouteTable to NatRT
Select NatRT  -- Subnet Associations -- Edit subnet Associations -- select private subnet-- save

Select NatRT  -- Routes -- Edit Routes --Add Route -- Target: NAT Gateway ( Select NAT )
Destination- 0.0.0.0/0  -- Save routes -- close

Now, lets test are we able to get internet to our DBServer.

Run the same command in putty again

# yum install mysql -y

It Works!!

Network ACL ( NACL )
----------------------------

Security group will provide security at instance level

NACL will provide security at subnet level.



Creating  NACL
------------------------
Select Network ACL ---- We have two default NACL
One for default VPC
One for MyVPC
( So, whenever we create new VPC, by default  NACL is created automatically )

We will create a new NACL and attach to public subnet
----------------------------------------------------------------
Create Network ACL -- Name Tag: PublicNACL
VPC: MyVPC
Create
Subnet Associations -- Edit subnet associations --select public subnet
Edit

------------





Now, try to access the webser
We cannot get the webpage !!! No


We need to open ports at NACL
Inbound rules ---- Edit inbound rules --Add rule

Rule#	Type		Source
100 	SSH		49.204.176.51/32  ( My laptop IP,we can get it from bastion security group ) 
200	HTTP		0.0.0.0/0			( HTTP open to all )

Save.





Now, try to access the webser
We cannot get the webpage !!!  No

We need to know about statefull and stateless
---------------------------------------
Lets select  webSecurity group  -- Inbound tab  -- edit





Did we add ports in outbound tab?

In security group, when we open inbound port, by default outbound port is open to all.
This status is called statefull.





So, we have opened HTTP incoming, by default outbound port is open to all.
Hence, we are able to access webserver.

This status is called statefull.


For NACL , The case is different.
We need to open outbound port  to NACL explicitly.
So, NACL is stateless






Select NACL -- Outbound Rules --- Edit Outbound Rules --- Add Rule 

Rule		Type		Destination	
100		SSH		183.83.38.112/32  ( MY IP )
200 		HTTP		0.0.0.0/0

Save

Now, can we able to access webserver
No!!!


Ephemeral ports
-----------------------
Total Range of ports :  0 to 65535
Range  1024 - 65535  are the range of ephemeral ports

search in google "ephemeral ports in AWS" , 
we can see the range

Assume in public subnet, we have 100 webservers
All are connected to load balancer.
If hacker blocks any http port on 1 webserver
Will it be a problem?
No!! 
As load balancer will send the request to other servers.

If hacker blocks any http port on NACL level  ( subnet level )
Entire website is down.

To avoid this problem, AWS is providing range of ports  ( 1024 - 65535 )

We need to open this range in NACL level,
So when hacker blocks a particular port ( HTTP ),  AWS uses a random port from the range.
AWS will replace  the  random as HTTP port.

So that website will never godown.




Note:  Ephemeral ports are mandatory at NACL level
++++++++++++++++++

Select --  PublicNACL --- Inbound  -- Edit inboud rules -- Add rule

Rule	Type			port range
300	Custom TCP Rule 		1024-65535

Save.

Now, can we able to access webserver?
No!!

NACL are stateless. We need to open ports  in outbound level also.

Select --  PublicNACL --- Outbound  -- Edit outboud rules -- Add rule

Rule	Type			port range
300	Custom TCP Rule 		1024-65535

Save.

++++++++++++++++++
Now, can we able to access webserver?
Yes!!



++++++++++++++++++++
WHat is the use of NACL?

Select our NACL -- inbound rules

Rule	Type
200	HTTP    we have opened to all.

Add Rule	
Rule#	Type		Allow/ Deny
201	HTTP		Deny

Save.


Similarly

Select our NACL -- outbound rules

Rule	Type
200	HTTP    we have opened to all.

Add Rule	Type		Allow/ Deny
201	HTTP		Deny

Save.

Now,  Are we able to access webserver?
Yes!!!
Conclusion, Lowest rule#  will have highest priority.


Now, in inbound rules
Rule# --  201  change to  199.
Save.

goto outboud rules
Rule# --  201  change to  199.
Save.

Now, 	 Lowest rule#  is 199  which is deny.
so, we cannot access the webserver.
No!!

Usecase:
-------------
Hacker is continuous accessing the webserver.
We want to block his IP, but other customers should be able
to access the webserver.

How can we do it.
Lets Assume, I am the hacker
Now, in inbound rules , change the source

Rule#			Source
199			49.204.176.51/32    ( My laptop  IP  )

Save.

 ( Network team will give us incoming request IP address)

Similarly in outboud rules also

Rule#			Source
199			106.217.195.229/32    ( My laptop  IP  )

Save.

Now, Are we able to access webserver  
No! ( As it is blocked to my machine )

But, others can able to access the webserver.

Imp Usecase:  By using NACL, we can block  specific IP address

Now,
Lets delete Rule# 199  from inbound and outbound level.
Save.

Now, Are we able to access webserver  
Yes!!!

NACL is not recommended to use for private subnet.

Step 1: Delete NAT
Step 2: Delete all Ec2 Machines
Step 3: Delete VPC
Step 4: Release Elastic IP
